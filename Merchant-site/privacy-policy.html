                            	<p>We require both the personal social security number of the owner of a Merchant and the Merchant’s federal taxpayer ID to provide the Merchant with a merchant account. When the Merchant enters its owner’s social security number and its federal taxpayer ID on our registration application form, we encrypt it using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We may use the Merchant’s and/or its owner’s name and social security number to request a credit report and to obtain a background report on the Merchant and its business, and on its owner. We take a number of security measures, such as encryption, to protect the privacy of information about the Merchant and its owner.</p>

We will, in some cases, have third parties assist us in providing the Services, and those third parties will have access to certain of the personally identifiable information provided by you (for example, financial institutions, credit card associations, member banks, network organizations, and vendors). We may also use information collected, including personal information, and may share such information with third parties in the following ways:</p>

We provide you the opportunity to unsubscribe from having your information used for certain purposes.

								<h4>Your California Privacy Rights</h4>
								<p>California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of such residents’ personal information to third parties for such third parties’ direct marketing purposes.

								<div class="spacer-30"></div>
								<h4>Security</h4>
								<p>We take every reasonable precaution to protect the confidentiality and security of your personal information by using industry recognized security safeguards such as site monitoring, secured networks and servers, firewalls, and encryption. When we ask for sensitive information, we protect it through the use of encryption during transmission, such as SSL (Secure Socket Layer). We regularly test and update our technology to enhance security. No method of transmission over the internet is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to protect your personal information within industry standards, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
								<p>Our employees are trained and required to safeguard your information. Our strict internal controls limit access to information based on job functionality.</p>
								<div class="spacer-30"></div>
								<h4>Protection of Cardholder and Customer Data</h4>
								<p>We are subject to the rules and regulations of credit and debit card associations and networks, such as VISA, MasterCard, Discover, Accel, NYCE, and Interlink. We are also compliant in regards to the security and safeguarding of cardholder information with “PCI DSS” (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards), and “CISP” (Cardholder Information Security Program). We comply with all related rules and regulations at all times. We undergo periodic third-party assessments and network scans to ensure that we have installed and maintained a firewall configuration to protect data; encrypt transmission of cardholder data and sensitive information across networks; restrict access of data to those that need to know; track and monitor all access to network resources and cardholder data; regularly test security systems and processes; assign a unique ID to each person with computer access; restrict physical access to cardholder data; and maintain a policy that addresses information security. Additional information regarding these requirements can be found at: http://usa.visa.com/merchants/risk_management/cisp.html</p>

								<h4>Use of Web Technologies</h44>
								<h5>Cookies</h5>
								<p>A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site. We may link the information we store in cookies to personally identifiable information you submit while on our site. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. A session ID cookie expires when a browser is closed. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site. You can remove the persistent cookies by following the directions provided in your internet browser’s “help” file. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site will be limited.</p>
								
								<h5>Clear Gifs</h5>
								<p>We employ a software technology called clear gifs (aka web beacons/web bugs), that helps us better manage the content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of a sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to your personally identifiable information.</p>
								<p>We use clear gifts in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please see “Choice/Opt-Out”.</p>
								
								<h5>Log Files</h5>
								<p>As is true of most websites, we gather information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.
We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.</p>

								<h5>Do Not Track</h5>
								<p>When you use one or more of our websites, we may receive “do not track” requests from you, whether via signals from Web browsers or other mechanisms. At this time, we do not respond to such “do not track” requests, although we may choose to do so in the future.</p>

								<h4>Manage Accurate Information</h4>
								<p>If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer choose to use our Services, you can visit our merchant forms site at http://Proxe Pay.com/ to download the corrective action form that is appropriate. You can also contact customer service by email, info@integratedmerchantservices.com, telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed below to assist you with changes to your account.</p>
								<p>To the extent your account(s) close or become inactive, we will continue to protect your information as described in this privacy policy.</p>
								<div class="spacer-30"></div>
								<h4>Business Transitions</h4>
								<p>In the event that we go through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition, or sales, your personal information will likely be among the assets transferred. You may not be notified of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information, although we will require that the acquirer agree to honor this Privacy Policy, as modified.</p>
